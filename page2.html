                The University of Pittsburgh (commonly referred to as Pitt) is a state-related research university located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br>
                In 1787 after the American Revolutionary War, it was founded on the edge of the American frontier as the Pittsburgh Academy.<br>
                It developed and was renamed as Western University of Pennsylvania by a change to its charter in 1819.<br>
                After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the Oakland neighborhood of the city;<br>
                it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution, until 1966 when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.
